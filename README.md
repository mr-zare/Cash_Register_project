**Translation**:

We intend to develop a device for a store that sells three types of products. Our device will have four inputs and a seven-segment display. It will take the dollar exchange rate and the price of each product as inputs, store this information internally, and allow the seller to update it as needed. Additionally, the device has another section used during sales. In this section, the seller will sequentially input the quantities of the first, second, and third products being sold. Finally, the total price in Tomans will be displayed on a seven-segment display.

### Explanation:

This text describes a **device** tailored for a store that manages three types of goods and their prices. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Inputs:**
   - Four inputs: one for the exchange rate (dollar to Toman) and three for the prices of the individual products.

2. **Storage:**
   - The device stores the entered prices and exchange rate until they are updated by the seller.

3. **Sales Functionality:**
   - The seller inputs the quantities of the products being sold.
   - The device calculates the total price in Tomans (local currency) using the stored exchange rate and product prices.

4. **Output:**
   - A seven-segment display shows the calculated total price.

The device serves two main purposes:
- **Price management:** Allowing the seller to input and update prices.
- **Transaction support:** Helping the seller calculate and display the total cost during sales.
